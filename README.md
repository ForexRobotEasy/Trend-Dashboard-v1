# Trend Dashboard

This code is a custom indicator called Trend Dashboard. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used to analyze trends in the forex market. The indicator calculates the trend direction based on the difference between the opening and closing prices of each candle.

## Indicator Input Parameters

- Timeframe: The timeframe for which the indicator should be calculated. The default value is the current chart timeframe.

## Indicator Buffers

The indicator uses four buffers to store the calculated values:

- TrendBuffer: Stores the trend direction for each candle.
- StochasticBuffer: Stores the stochastic oscillator values.
- RSIBuffer: Stores the relative strength index (RSI) values.
- CCIBuffer: Stores the commodity channel index (CCI) values.

## Custom Indicator Initialization Function

The OnInit() function is called when the indicator is initialized. In this function, the indicator buffers are set using the SetIndexBuffer() function. The short name of the indicator is set using the IndicatorSetString() function.

## Custom Indicator Iteration Function

The OnCalculate() function is called for each new candle on the chart. In this function, the indicator calculates the trend direction, stochastic oscillator, RSI, and CCI values for each candle. It uses the CalculateTrend() function to calculate the trend direction based on the difference between the opening and closing prices.

The market direction is determined by summing up the trend values for all candles. If the sum is positive, it indicates an upward trend. If the sum is negative, it indicates a downward trend. If the sum is zero, it indicates no trend.

The market direction is printed using the Print() function.

## Custom Trend Calculation Function

The CalculateTrend() function is a helper function that calculates the trend direction based on the difference between the opening and closing prices. If the difference is positive, it indicates an upward trend. If the difference is negative, it indicates a downward trend. If the difference is zero, it indicates no trend.
